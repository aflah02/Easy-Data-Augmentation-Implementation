# Easy Data Augmentation Implementation

My Implementation for the paper [EDA: Easy Data Augmentation Techniques for Boosting Performance on Text Classification Tasks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.11196.pdf) using Tensorflow

I have reimplemented the 4 Data Augmentation Techniques Described in the Paper and tested it on the SST2 dataset acquired from [here](https://github.com/clairett/pytorch-sentiment-classification/tree/master/data/SST2)
