# Easy Data Augmentation Implementation

My Implementation for the paper [EDA: Easy Data Augmentation Techniques for Boosting Performance on Text Classification Tasks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.11196.pdf) using Tensorflow

I have reimplemented the 4 Data Augmentation Techniques Described in the Paper and tested it on the SST2 dataset acquired from [here](https://github.com/clairett/pytorch-sentiment-classification/tree/master/data/SST2)

I've also discussed the paper [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pLhrjjSa28)

How can you run this?

Just open the .ipynb file, click on run on colab, set runtime to GPU (for speedy training) and run all cells (everything else is already handled)
