# Easy Data Augmentation Implementation

This repository contains my Implementation for the paper [EDA: Easy Data Augmentation Techniques for Boosting Performance on Text Classification Tasks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.11196.pdf) using Tensorflow

I have reimplemented the 4 Data Augmentation Techniques Described in the Paper and tested it on the SST2 dataset acquired from [here](https://github.com/clairett/pytorch-sentiment-classification/tree/master/data/SST2)

p.s. I have also discussed and gone through the paper [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pLhrjjSa28)

FAQs- 

*Q- How can I run this?*

A - Just open the .ipynb file, click on the "open in colab" button location at the start of the notebook, set runtime to GPU (for speedy training) and run all cells (everything else is already handled)
